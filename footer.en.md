## HINTS

To make a Sass (SCSS) stylesheet, create a new file with a `.scss` extension and start writing SCSS. When you are done, you must run:

```sh
$ {appname} verify stylesheet.scss
```

to proceed. Your stylesheet will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
